# Important Calculator For Modern People
## Prologue
The more the world develops, the more societal expectation and pressure every human being has to deal with, and hence the unhealthier they get. Many applications and software have been invented to respond to people's needs, ranging from education to amusement. However, the modern world has long forgotten one, and very crucial but underrated, aspect - physical and mental health. Although a few early health applications have emerged to address such an issue, the public health, at least in the US, is still alarming. Thus, we together designed and created this application to help users keep track of some aspects of quantitative physical health.

## Application Demonstration

## Overview
This is a calculator group including four different health calculators depending on users' health needs, namely [Calorie Calculator](src/Calorie_Calculator), [BMI Calculator](src/bmi_calculator), [Pregnancy Calculator](src/Pregnancy_calculator), [and One Rep Max Calculator](src/OneRepMax). More on these four calculators can be found [here](https://www.calculator.net/fitness-and-health-calculator.html) and [here](https://americanpregnancy.org/resources/pregnancy-calculator/). One thing to note is that there may seem an outlier, the Pregnancy Calculator, in the midst of the other three fitness calculators. The reason why we decided to incorporate it was because we can imagine how hard it is for pregnant women to keep fit since women after childbearing tend more likely to become overweight and experience non-transmitted diseases such as Type II Diabetes, so it should be ideal to make a tool for them to monitor their pregnancy status and then come up with latter healthful moves - maybe to do some gentle yoga, but we never and ever recommend them weight-lifting!
## Discussion
### The Homepage
This serves as the main interface containing all four calculators, which looks like this when [`Homepage.java`](src/homepage/HomePage.java) is executed:
