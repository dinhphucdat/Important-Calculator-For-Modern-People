# Important Calculator For Modern People
## Prologue
The more the world develops, the more societal expectation and pressure every human being has to deal with, and hence the unhealthier they get. Many applications and software have been invented to respond to people's needs, ranging from education to amusement. However, the modern world has long forgotten one, and very crucial but underrated, aspect - physical and mental health. Although a few early health applications have emerged to address such an issue, the public health, at least in the US, is still alarming. Thus, we together designed and created this application to help users keep track of some aspects of quantitative physical health.
