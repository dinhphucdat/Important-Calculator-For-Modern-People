Severe thinness
Your BMI indicates that you are underweight. Being underweight may be a sign of malnutrition or underlying health issues that need attention.

To improve your health, focus on incorporating calorie-dense and nutrient-rich foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins into your diet. Avoid skipping meals and consider adding healthy snacks between meals.

It’s a good idea to consult a healthcare provider or dietitian to identify any specific causes and create a plan to reach a healthier weight.

BMI Prime is a variant of the standard BMI that compares an individual's BMI to the upper limit of a normal BMI range. It provides a more nuanced view of weight status by measuring how far an individual's BMI is from the upper threshold of a healthy BMI (usually 25).

BMI Prime is calculated by dividing the individual's BMI by 25. This makes it easier to interpret an individual's BMI in terms of how close or far they are from the healthy weight range. A BMI Prime of 1 means the individual has a BMI of 25, which is the threshold between normal weight and overweight. A BMI Prime greater than 1 indicates overweight or obese status.

BMI Prime can be a helpful metric for assessing the risk of conditions associated with overweight and obesity. If someone has a BMI Prime of 1.2, for example, it means their BMI is 30 (overweight), which suggests an increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and other health issues. BMI Prime provides a more relative and less absolute measure of excess weight.

Normal
Congratulations! Your BMI falls within the normal, 
healthy range. This means that your weight is likely well-balanced with your height.

To maintain your health, keep focusing on a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Staying physically active, with at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, will help you sustain this state of wellness.

Regular check-ups with your doctor can help monitor your overall health and make sure you’re on the right track.

Overweight
Your BMI falls within the overweight range. While not immediately dangerous, being overweight may increase your risk for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and joint problems if left unaddressed.

Adopting a healthier lifestyle can help improve your BMI. Start with small steps like reducing processed and high-sugar foods in your diet, and replacing them with fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Incorporating regular physical activity, even just walking or light jogging, can make a big difference over time.

For tailored advice, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or nutritionist to create a plan that works best for your needs and goals.

Obese Class I
Your BMI indicates obesity, which can increase your risk for serious health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

It’s crucial to work towards a healthier weight to reduce these risks. Start by setting achievable goals, such as eating more home-cooked meals, choosing smaller portions, and including more fresh produce in your diet. Regular exercise is equally important—begin with activities you enjoy, like swimming or yoga, and gradually increase your activity level.

Because managing obesity often involves more than just diet and exercise, consulting a healthcare provider is highly recommended. They can help you explore additional options, like structured weight loss programs, behavioral counseling, or other interventions.
